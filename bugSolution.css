The solution involves either removing the inline style or using an ID selector which has higher specificity than any class selector. Here's the corrected CSS:

```css
.container {
  width: 200px;
  height: 200px;
  background-color: lightblue;
}

.container p {
  font-size: 16px;
}

.container p.special {
  font-size: 24px;
}

#special-paragraph {
  font-size: 24px;
}
```

By removing the inline style or using `id` selectors, we ensure that the CSS rules are applied according to their intended specificity.
